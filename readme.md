# Service Business Management System

I'm building an app that will support my IT consulting business using [Laravel PHP framework](http://laravel.com).

## Why create this app?

Yes there are other tried and tested CRMs and IT support apps out there but I wanted an app that is light weight and designed specifically for sole trader or small consulting business with fewer than 10 team members.

The app will focus on taking responsibility rather than blaming others, making excuses, justifying poor actions. 

The app aims to do this by preventing the common problems experienced by:

* clients during IT support life cycle

* Business owners operating an IT consulting business

* IT team members during IT support life cycle

Ultimately I want to systematically and predictably deliver great value to my clients, team members, my community and my family.
