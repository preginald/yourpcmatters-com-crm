# Service Business Management System

I'm building an app that will support my IT consulting business using [Laravel PHP framework](http://laravel.com).

## Why create this app when others exist?

* designed specifically for the sole trader or small consulting business with fewer than 10 team members.
* solves common problems clients experience during IT support life cycle
* solves common problems we experience running an IT consulting business
* solves common problems IT team members exprience during IT support life cycle
* aims to improve client appreciation levels
